# Thresholding Wet Regions
This is a fork of [Daniel Stabile](https://github.com/FalseFeint)'s original repo on his peeling project thresholding algorithm. 

The major adaptations include modifying the code to work on wet region segmentation on human body parts. 

You can find the code changes in `batch_classification.py` and `region_segmentation.py`. 
The samples used for processing are found in `img_data/new_wet_samples` and `img_data/old_wet_samples_real_humans`.
